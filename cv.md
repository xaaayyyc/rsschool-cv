## About me:
Hello. I am 22. In 2018, I have start education in Kursk State University in the pedagogical direction. After a while (3-4 years) I understand that's not mine and start learl Front-end technologies.
My purpose is to engage and work in the field in which I have always been drawn. I have always been drawn to programming. I am easily communicative and capable of learning. Calm and stress resistant. I like to look for non-standard solutions.
I have little experience in programming. Mostly it is completing university tasks and helping for my classmates. Now I work and teach robotics and programming at a children's center.
I will become a good front-end developer, I will succeed. I believe in it.

## Code example:
A task that I came up with myself in process learning JavaScript on one of courses:
```
// Displaying the amount in a line of the form: "Ваши входние данные Множитель1 * Множитель два. Произведение равно Произведение."
// Use: arrow functions, syntax ${variable}.

// Declaring Variables
const firstFactor = 5
const secondFactor = 7

// Functions
const printInfo = (firstFactor, secondFactor) => {
    console.log(`Ваши входные данные: ${firstFactor} умножается на ${secondFactor} .`)
}

const printProcess = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {console.log('///.......')}, 2000)
    setTimeout(() => {console.log('//////....')}, 4000)
    setTimeout(() => {console.log('/////////.')}, 6000)
    setTimeout(() => {console.log('//////////')}, 7000)
    setTimeout(() => {console.log('...Done!...')}, 7700)
}

const printResult = (firstFactor, secondFactor) => {
    const resultVariable = firstFactor * secondFactor
    console.log(`Результат умножения чисел ${firstFactor} и ${secondFactor} равен ${resultVariable}`)
}

// Programm
printInfo(firstFactor, secondFactor)
printProcess()
setTimeout(() => {printResult(firstFactor, secondFactor)}, 8500)
```
