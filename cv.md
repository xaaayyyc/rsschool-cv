## About me:
Hello. I am 22. In 2018, I have start education in Kursk State University in the pedagogical direction. After a while (3-4 years) I understand that's not mine and start learl Front-end technologies.
My purpose is to engage and work in the field in which I have always been drawn. I have always been drawn to programming. I am easily communicative and capable of learning. Calm and stress resistant. I like to look for non-standard solutions.
I have little experience in programming. Mostly it is completing university tasks and helping for my classmates. Now I work and teach robotics and programming at a children's center.
I will become a good front-end developer, I will succeed. I believe in it.
